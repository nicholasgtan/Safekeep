### About the project

As my final (capstone) project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course, I decided to go back to my finance roots referencing my time as an institutional account manager for custody service clients. This client facing application is used by clients daily to manage their accounts and transactions with the custodian. I have simplified the database in view of the tight timeline for this project, however, the basic functionality of viewing account/trade data and creating trades will be showcased here.
